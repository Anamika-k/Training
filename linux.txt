        wq : Write and quit (save and exit).
        w fileName : Write to file called fileName (save as).
        w! fileName : Overwrite to file called fileName (save as forcefully).

Searching and Replacing in (ex Mode): vi also has powerful search and replace capabilities. 
The formal syntax for searching is:

:s/string used for search the pattern.
